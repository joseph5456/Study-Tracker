# Study-Tracker
Ivan Ivanov, Joseph Nguyen, Megan Schubert
Purpose: Create a stuy tracker with a calendar and study timer 
Tools Utilized: Javascript, Css, HTML, Git hub, Vs Code
Problems we ran into: We had to sync all of our branches together in GitHub, and merging all of our code together. We over came this issue by testing multiple lines of code and using the ones that worked. We also faced the problem of implementing the calendar and timer into the UI, we did this by using CSS and HTML to combine the Javascript files.
